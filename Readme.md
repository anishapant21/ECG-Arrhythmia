### ECG Arrhythmia Classification using SVM, Logistic Regression, 1D-CNN

Training and testing of the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset obtained from physionet using SVM, Logistic Regression and 1D-CNN in order to predict the anomalies that exist. Based on the R-peak of ECG signal, we classify the ECG signals into categories including Normal and arrhythmias like Left and Right Bundle Branch Block, Premature Ventricular Contraction, Ventricular Escape Rhythm, Paced Rhythm, andÂ Atrial Premature Contraction. The dataset is preprocessed (segmentation, resampling, standarization) before training the model.
